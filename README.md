# House-Price-Prediction
This is my submission to the Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle using XGBoost for prediction.

**Goal:**

to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

Machine Learning Models
Used Models:
Gradient Boosting Regressor

**Preprocessing:**

Data preprocessing is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model. by passing two separate objects to the preprocessing methods
one is representing the training data and the other represents the unseen data for testing.

**Feature Engineering:**
to facilitate the machine learning process and increases the predictive power of machine learning algorithms by creating features from raw data.

**Model Fitting and Prediction:**

measureing how well the model generalizes to similar data to that on which it was trained.
and predicting the outcome of the data
